					<p>Would you believe me if I told you that this site was built with no libraries, frameworks, or IDEs? Seriously. Pure Javascript6, HTML5, and CSS3. That's all it takes these days.</p>

					<p>I really got my start in front-end development when I worked for Vidao Messenger Inc., creating Vidao.com. I had an awesome manager who insisted on keeping up with the times, and becuase it was a brand ne project, we didn't have to worry about upgrading old systems. We could start fresh with something new and amazing!<br />A co-worker and I were then asked to investigate Polymer, a new library brought out by google that utilized the WebComponents standard, and compare it to AngularJS. About a week later, with the decision left up to us, we chose Polymer for the website. It felt so light-weight and intuitive.</p>
