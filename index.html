					<div class="title">Hello, my friend! Stay awhile and listen.</div>
					<div class="content">
						<p>Yes, I'm a nerd. I play video games, I write fiction stories, I enjoy drawing and painting, and I'm a programmer. But don't try to stereotype me. I'm Canadian, but I hate the cold - and no, I don't eat blubber, live in an igloo, or own a dogsled. I'm a woman, but I can't cook. I'm an introvert, but I'm NOT shy. I'm a gamer, but I'm not a shut-in. I'm a writer, but I don't own a cat - dogs only! I'm an artist, but my head is not in the clouds. I'm a programmer, but no, I won't fix your computer.</p>

						<p>I've cleaned toilets, mowed lawns, and scrubbed dishes. Now, I'm cleaning code, mowing bugs, and staying as far away from dishes as I can!</p>

					<div class="title">The best four years of my life!</div>
					<div class="content">
						<p>I graduated from the University of Northern British Columbia (UNBC) in 2014 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science; I'm extraordinarily proud of my degree. While the program had been nurfed in recent years, it still provided an excellent introduction to various topics and indepth knowledge of programming theory. I studied Knowledge-Based Systems, Distributed Systems, Multi-Agent Systems, Compilers, General Software Engineering, Data Structures, Algorithms, Databases, Artificial Intelligence, Programming Languages, Operating Systems, Functional & Logical Programming, Combinatorics, and Statistics.</p>

						<p>They didn't just teach us languages, libraries, or platforms. They taught us the nitty-gritty, "behind-the-scenes", "whats and whys" of programming. We built data structures, compilers, and databases from scratch - without the use of frameworks, libraries, or IDEs. We studies autonomous systems and artificial intelligence to discover the depth of math and programming in the modern age. We didn't just learn languages... we wrote our own... then compiled and tested it! We programmed in Assembly to learn operating systems, and built motherboards to learn combinatorics. We were taught how to think and how to learn... Now? I can learn anything because I have the basics, the theory, the building blocks of engineering!</p>
					</div>

					<div class="title">From theory to practical.</div>
					<div class="content">
						<p>My education left me scared to death about entering the workforce. I felt like I knew nothing, had learned nothing, that I couldn't compete with those that had gone to college and studied two straight years of Javascript, JQuery, or AngularJS... Turns out I was wrong. I found a company the allowed me to learn, and while I was stuck at a disadvantage over another new hire who'd gone to colledge initially, within 2 weeks, I had far surpassed the knowledge they they'd ever gained. I learned what had taken them 2 years in a couple weeks. I flew threw assignments and tasks with high praise.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="title">Then to theoretical again...</div>
					<div class="content">
						<p>Idealy, I want to get back to my roots. I love front-end web development for the immediate satisfaction I get when I view my work. However, the theoretical is what I know and love. I want to constantly be expanding my skills. I want to delve into back-end and blow everyone else away, and want to try my hand at database administration to understand why they are paid so much, I'd love to get into video game development and maybe even graphic design. Who knows? For me, the future is limitless!</p>
